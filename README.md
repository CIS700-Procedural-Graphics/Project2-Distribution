## Project Description

I procedurally generated and animated a model of a bird wing. 

## Project Features

The basic wing model is generated from three separate spline curves in the XZ direction. Each curve is offset in the Y direction by a cosine function based on its position. Feathers are apppended to each curve, and their size is based on the position on the curve. The wing moves with a function which rotates each feather based on time. 

Interactive Features Include:

a. Wing shape

b. Feather size

c. Feather color

d. Feather orientation

e. Flapping speed

f. Flapping motion
