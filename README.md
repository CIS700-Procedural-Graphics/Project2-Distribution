Usage and features:

Feathers can be culled with perlin noise. Use the drop down menu.
Options for the find animation are controlled by options labelled as noise. Control the speed, intensity and scale of this noise with sliders.
Use the color picker to change the color.
Number of feathers can be changed with numRow and numCol. BUG: Make sure to click and not drag these sliders
The wing has a simple sinusoidal flap. Its curvature is determined by curveBias. You can use the range and speed sliders to change the flap.
