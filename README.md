## Objective

Learn how to use different functions to make a bird wing.

## Process

I started off deciding which of the functions taught I would like to use to make my bird wing. I saved the bird feather geometry read by the OBJLoader and used it to make my wing. I created several layers for my wing and each layer is aligned differently based on a number of parameters. Then, I finally added the time component by adding some wing and flapping.

## Interactivity

Using dat.GUI, I added sliders to affect the curvature, distribution, size, orientation, and color of the feathers and speed of motion of wind and flapping.
