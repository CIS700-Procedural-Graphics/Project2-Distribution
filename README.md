# [Project2: Toolbox Functions](https://github.com/CIS700-Procedural-Graphics/Project2-Toolbox-Functions)
This project is a procedurally modeled and animated wing. I started by creating a bezier curve and spawning feathers along this curve. I animated the wing by using a sin wave that took in time with a parameter and rotating it along the z axis. I did a similar action on the x and y directions based on the wind to create a small vibration. You can probably see the vibration if you look at the upper right hand feathers. I controlled the orientation and size of the feathers with a bias function. I also varied the color using a bias function as well. A user can change the base color of the feathers as well as the curvature, size, orientation, and animation.
