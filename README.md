# [Procedural Wing](https:rms13.github.io/Project2-Toolbox-Functions)

## Overview

The objective of this assignment is to procedurally model and animate a bird wing. Let's get creative!

## Modeling

Catmull Rom Splines are used to create the shape of the wing. Feathers are distributed over the curve in three layers with some randomness in position.

## Animation

Wind force is simulated using just random vibrations.
Wing Flapping is simulated using sine waves and some randomness.

## Interactivity

1. Feather size - coming soon
2. Feather color - coming soon
3. Feather orientation
4. Flapping speed
5. Flapping motion/Shape
6. Wind Speed
7. Amplitude
