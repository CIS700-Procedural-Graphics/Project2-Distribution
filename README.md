## Overview

This is an animation of a bird wing. In a bird wing, feathers closer to the bird's body tend to be more clustered whereas feathers further away tend to be more spread out. Additionally, feathers at the top of its arm are typically smaller than the feathers lower down on its wing. 

The wing is customizable. You should change the feather's colors and size. You can also change its flapping speeds and how big it's wing motion is.
